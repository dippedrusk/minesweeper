# Minesweeper

## Rules 
* The number of mines in a board and the size of the board is predetermined by the player. The default board size is 9 * 9, and the number of mines in the board is 10. 
* A "square" indicates any of the units in the game of minesweeper that contain either a number, a blank("0"), or a mine.
* Left-clicking the square to reveal the content.
* If a square is successfully opened without containing a mine, it shows a number. The number indicates the number of mines that exist in the eight squares touching the square the number was in.
* Right-clicking the square, a flag appears over the square. Right-clicking again to remove the flag. 
* The game of minesweeper is won at the point when all squares that are not mines are clicked open.
* The game of minesweeper is lost there is any inaccuracy in the flagging around the number or a square that the player clicks open contains a mine.
* Clicking the smiling face to restart the game.
